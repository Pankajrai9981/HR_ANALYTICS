# HR_ANALYTICS
Created dynamic dashboard from hr_analytics data

Process Steps:

1.Data Extraction: I obtained the data for this project from Kaggle, a popular data science platform.
2.Data Cleaning: Once the data was extracted, I performed a data cleaning process. Power Query was utilized to import the extracted data into Power BI. Various data cleaning techniques were applied to ensure data integrity and consistency.
3.Data Exploration: After cleaning the data, I conducted a thorough analysis to uncover potential insights and identify reasons for employee resignations. This step involved exploring the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
4.Data Presentation: The insights gained from the data exploration were visually presented using a variety of charts and graphs. This approach effectively communicated the findings to stakeholders and decision-makers."
